# Project: Calibration and Fusion of Classifiers

## Calibration of Classifier Scores

### Objective
We aim to calibrate the scores of the best-performing classifiers from the previous analysis (GMM, Logistic Regression, and SVM). Calibration aims to improve the decision-making of these models, particularly for specific target applications, by transforming the scores to better reflect the probability of belonging to a particular class.

### Steps:

1. **Calibration Transformation**:
   - For each method (GMM, Logistic Regression, and SVM), compute a **calibration transformation** for the scores of the best-performing classifier selected earlier.
   - Use the **validation set** employed in previous evaluations (i.e., the validation split used to measure performance).
   - Apply a **K-fold approach** to compute and evaluate the calibration transformation.

2. **Training Priors**:
   - Experiment with different priors for training the logistic regression model used for calibration.
   - The **training prior** may differ from the **target application prior**, but the evaluation must be done using the target application prior.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - For each model, select the calibration transformation that provides the lowest **actual DCF** in the K-fold cross-validation for the target application.
   - Compute both the **minimum DCF** and the **actual DCF** of the calibrated scores for the different systems.
   
4. **Observations**:
   - Did calibration improve the actual DCF for the target application?
   - Analyze the **Bayes error plots** to understand performance for different applications.

## Score-Level Fusion of Best-Performing Models

### Objective
Perform a score-level fusion of the best-performing models from each classification method (GMM, Logistic Regression, SVM) to improve classification performance.

### Steps:

1. **Fusion Model**:
   - Try different priors for training logistic regression to fuse the scores of the best-performing models.
   - Select the model that provides the best **actual DCF** for the target application.

2. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Compute the **minimum DCF** and **actual DCF** of the resulting fused model.
   
3. **Observations**:
   - Is the fusion improving the actual DCF compared to the individual systems?
   - Are the fused scores well-calibrated?

## Selection of the Final Model

### Objective
Choose the final model that will be used as the "delivered" system for the application data.

1. **Justification**:
   - Justify the choice of the final model based on the results of calibration and fusion.
   - Consider performance across different metrics (actual DCF, minimum DCF, calibration).

# Evaluation of the Final Delivered System

The final step involves evaluating the chosen model on a separate evaluation dataset (`Project/evalData.txt`). This dataset is used only for evaluation and must not be employed to estimate anything.

## Steps:

1. **Evaluate the Final Delivered System**:
   - Compute the **minimum DCF** and **actual DCF** for the delivered system.
   - Generate **Bayes error plots** for the target application and other possible applications.

2. **Observations**:
   - Are the scores well-calibrated for the target application?
   - How does the system perform for other possible applications?

## Comparison of the Best Performing Systems and Fusion

### Steps:

1. **Evaluate the Best Systems**:
   - Consider the three best-performing systems and their fusion.
   - Evaluate the **actual DCF** for each and compare their **actual DCF error plots**.

2. **Observations**:
   - Was the final model choice effective?
   - Would another model or a fusion of models have been more effective?

## Analysis of Calibration Strategy

### Steps:

1. **Evaluate the Three Best Systems**:
   - For each of the three best systems, evaluate the **minimum DCF** and **actual DCF** for the target application.
   - Analyze the **Bayes error plots** to assess the calibration effectiveness for each approach.

2. **Observations**:
   - Was the calibration strategy effective across the different approaches?

## Analysis of the Training Strategy for One Approach

### Objective
Analyze whether the training strategy for one of the three approaches (e.g., logistic regression) was effective.

### Steps:

1. **Review All Trained Models**:
   - Consider all models that were trained for the selected approach (e.g., different hyper-parameters, pre-processing combinations for logistic regression).

2. **Evaluate Minimum DCF**:
   - Evaluate the **minimum DCF** of these models on the evaluation dataset and compare it to the minimum DCF of the selected final model.
   - For brevity, skip the re-calibration of all models and focus on minimum DCF comparisons.

3. **Observations**:
   - Was the chosen model close to optimal for the evaluation data?
   - Were there different model choices that would have led to better performance?
