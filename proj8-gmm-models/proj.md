# Project: GMM Models for Classification

## Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) Application

### Full Covariance Models

1. **Objective**:
   - We apply GMM models to classify the project data.
   - For each class, we need to determine the optimal number of Gaussian components (a key hyperparameter for the model).

2. **Model Setup**:
   - Train **full covariance GMM models** with different numbers of components for each class.
   - To avoid excessive training time, restrict the models to a maximum of **32 components**.
   
3. **Validation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of each model on the validation set.
   - Use the **minimum DCF** for the target application to guide model selection.

4. **Observations**:
   - What do you observe in terms of performance as you vary the number of components?
   - Are there combinations of components that work better than others?
   - Are the results in line with your expectations based on the characteristics of the dataset?
   - Are there any surprising results?
     - **Optional**: Can you explain these surprising results?

### Diagonal Covariance Models

1. **Model Setup**:
   - Repeat the analysis with **diagonal covariance GMM models**.

2. **Validation**:
   - Again, evaluate the models based on their **minimum DCF** for the target application.

3. **Observations**:
   - How do the results of the diagonal covariance models compare to the full covariance models?
   - Are there combinations of components that work better for the diagonal models?
   - Do the results match your expectations based on the dataset?

### Model Comparison

1. **Main Methods**:
   - We have now analyzed all the major classifiers covered in the course:
     - **GMM**
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **SVM**
   - (We ignore **MVG** as its results are expected to be significantly worse than the other models, but feel free to test it as well.)

2. **Best Performing Candidates**:
   - For each method (GMM, logistic regression, SVM), select the best-performing model based on the **minimum DCF**.
   
3. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the selected models in terms of both **minimum DCF** and **actual DCF**.
   - Which method appears to be the most promising for the given application?

## Alternative Applications

### Qualitative Analysis for Different Applications

1. **Objective**:
   - Perform a qualitative analysis of the performance of the three selected models for different applications.

2. **Bayes Error Plot**:
   - Use a **Bayes error plot** to visualize the **actual DCF** and **minimum DCF** for each model across a wide range of operating points (e.g., log-odds ranging from âˆ’4 to +4).

3. **Observations**:
   - What do you observe across different operating points?
   - In terms of **minimum DCF**, do the results preserve the relative ranking of the models?
   - What about **actual DCF**?
     - Are there models that seem well-calibrated across most of the operating point range?
     - Are there models that show significant miscalibration?
     - Are there models that could be harmful for certain applications?

## Conclusion

- Summarize the findings from your GMM, logistic regression, and SVM analyses.
- Discuss which model(s) performed best overall and for different application scenarios.
